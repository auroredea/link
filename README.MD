## Getting Started

You should probably change the following things:
- lang attribute for the html tag
- title in head tag
- favicon in asset folder
- userPhoto in asset folder
- userName
- links (duh!)
- footer content

## Add a new link

To add a new link, just duplicate an existing line between the links div or add a new one like this

```
<a class="link" href="#" target="_blank">#</a>
```


## Add Emojis

If you want to add emojis to your links, you can Copy/Paste them via [GetEmoji](https://getemoji.com/).
